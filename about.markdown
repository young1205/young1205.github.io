I currently live in Edinboro, PA which is a small town about 30 minutes south of Erie and 90 minutes north of Pittsburgh. 

I started out my career in physics where I studied weak gravitational lensing. One of the projects I worked on was the [Great 10 Galaxy Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5254) where I ran a software pipeline (KSB) that performed very well.

More recently I have been working as a software engineer for [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us) where one of the teams I worked on was the [Marketplace API](https://developer.cms.gov/marketplace-api/) which supplied data for [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov)
