I decided to refresh my personal website so I built a new Jekyll website from scratch. Although it is an option to use Jekyll themes I decided to create one from the basic Minima theme that occurs when you type:

{% highlight ruby %}
jekyll new 
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
