I decided to refresh my personal website so I built a new [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website from scratch. Jekyll is an amazing Ruby gem that enables you to easily create a static website.   Since GitHub Pages is powered by Jekyll, it is easy to deploy a site using GitHub. Another nice feature of Jekyll is that the documentation is through and easy to understand

To get my website up and running I followed the tutorials [Installing Jekyll on macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) and [Jekyll Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

The first step if you are on a Mac or Linux machine is to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Homebrew makes it easy to install and update packages. In a terminal run 
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
<br>
Install chruby and ruby-install with Homebrew
```
brew install chruby ruby-install xz
```
<br>
Install the latest stable version of Ruby (supported by Jekyll):
```
ruby-install ruby 3.1.3
```
<br>
Configure your shell to automatically use chruby
```
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "chruby ruby-3.1.3" >> ~/.zshrc # run 'chruby' to see actual version
```
<br>
Now that ruby is installed you can install jekyll
```
gem install jekyll bundler
```
<br>
Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog.
```
jekyll new myblog
```
<br>
Change into your new directory.
```
cd myblog
```
<br>
To view this locally
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
<br>
Your website should now be visible at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
<br>
<br>
<br>
# Your blog should look like this !
