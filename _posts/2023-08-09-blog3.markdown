# Goal 
This is a tutorial about how to build a simple Ruby on Rails website that has data on authors and poems. 
<br>

# Setup
To run this website you will need to have installed Ruby on Rails. There is a excellent resource of how to install Ruby on Rails at [http://www.installrails.com](http://www.installrails.com) that has step by step guides for different systems (Mac, Windows)
<br>

# Tutorial
Open your terminal and find a convenient location to install your project then build your initial setup
```
rails new poetry_project
```
then enter your new directory
```
cd poetry_project
```
Now you need to open an editor. I personally like using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) but you can use your editor of choice.
<br>
When you open your editor you should see something like this:
![](/assets/ROR_P1.png)
<br>
<br>
Go ahead and start the server
```
rails s
```
then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser window. 
<br>
<br>
It should look like:
![](/assets/ROR_P2.png)
<br>
<br>
Open up a new terminal and enter 
```
rails g controller about index
```
<br>
Going to `config/routes.rb` change the file to 
{% highlight ruby  %} 
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'about' =>'about#index'
  # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  # Defines the root path route ("/")
  # root "articles#index"
end
{% endhighlight %}
<br>
To be continued.....
