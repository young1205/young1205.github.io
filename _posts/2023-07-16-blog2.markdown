# Overview
My example RESTfull API in Express (Node.js) without a Database for device readings. 

# Requirements 
The API we are building will recieve and process device readings. The requirements for this API is that it must be able to record new device readings and return a list of readings given a device id.

# Format
We know Devices send readings via HTTP POST requests with the following JSON: 
```
{
    "id": "36",
    "readings": [
        {
            "timestamp": "2021-09-29",
            "count": 2
        },
        {
            "timestamp": "2021-09-30",
            "count": 5
        },
        {
            "timestamp": "2021-10-1",
            "count": 5
        }
    ]
}
```
<br>
We also know that given a device id clients can fetch the list of readings via a HTTP GET request. The
API returns the following JSON:
```
{
    "readings": [
        {
            "timestamp": "2021-09-29",
            "count": 2
        },
        {
            "timestamp": "2021-10-1",
            "count": 5
        }
    ]
}
```
